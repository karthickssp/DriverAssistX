# DriverAssistX

## Overview
DriverAssistX is an AI-powered system designed for real-time road sign recognition and hand gesture detection to assist human drivers. It utilizes deep learning and computer vision techniques to enhance road safety and driver assistance.

## Features

- ðŸš¦ **Traffic Sign Recognition** using a trained CNN model.
- âœ‹ **Hand Gesture Detection** using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- ðŸŽ¥ **Real-Time Detection** via a webcam.
- ðŸ”„ **Seamless Switching** between sign and gesture recognition based on detected input.
- ðŸ“¢ **Voice Feedback** for recognized signs and gestures.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow/Keras, Tkinter, PyTTSX3
- **Machine Learning:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- **Hardware:** Webcam for real-time video feed

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (3.8+ recommended) and install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install opencv-python mediapipe tensorflow keras numpy pillow pyttsx3
```

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/karthickssp/DriverAssistX.git
cd DriverAssistX
```

### Run the Application
```sh
python PredictFinal.py
```

## Usage

- **Upload an Image:** Select an image for classification.
- **Real-Time Detection:** Use a webcam to detect road signs or hand gestures.
- **Voice Feedback:** Recognized inputs are displayed on the screen and spoken aloud.
